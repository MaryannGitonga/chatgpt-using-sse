## Client-side

### Technologies:
1. React (with TypeScript)

### Initial Setup
This is not necessary in this project since the setup is already done. It's just for the sake of knowing how to go about it, incase you'd like to set up a React project using Vite :)

Feel free to refer to the files in this repo for better context on changes needed.

#### Package Installs
- Initialize a React project using `npm create vite` (select React -> TypeScript)
- Install dependencies using `npm install`

#### Project-specific Installs
- Install Ant Design for React `npm install antd --save`
